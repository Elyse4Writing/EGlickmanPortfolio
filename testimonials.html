                        <BLOCKQUOTE>"I was introduced to Elyse Glickman’s work as a writer and editor via Beverage Industry News, and really enjoyed working with her during our time at Food & Beverage Magazine. While I gave her freelance assignments focused on restaurant industry trends (such as interior design, economy-driven promotions and the evolving industry of food tourism in the U.S.), she had a nice way of making her copy engaging while hitting the necessary business issues.  She also did a fine job on pieces that had her traveling to other cities, from San Diego to Calgary to Montego Bay, Jamaica, to show our readership what restaurateurs were doing to get and retain customers in these places. She is also exceptionally good at meeting her deadlines and taking direction when and if rewrites are needed."</BLOCKQUOTE>

I also said you were by far the most productive of all the reporters who went on the 3 trips we took to Honduras last year (tourism/hospitality, light manufacturing, and agribusiness). The FIDE people (Honduras) were very pleased with the articles, by the way. I hope one of these days we get another client and a budget for press trips so I can invite you somewhere else!"</BLOCKQUOTE>
